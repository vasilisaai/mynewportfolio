        <div class="post-body"><p><strong>Chicago, “Nicole Eisenman: What Happened” (Until Sept. 22)</strong>
 “We have to have a sense of humor,” says artist Nicole Eisenman. It’s a philosophy that comes through in her paintings: portraits of togetherness that are bright and busy while reflecting sober issues of the present. To Eisenman, the beauty of intimacy offers hope. The MCA presents the first major survey of her work, with murals from her early career in New York to her pertinent work of today. <a href="https://visit.mcachicago.org/exhibitions/nicole-eisenman-what-happened/"><em>mcachicago.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Joshua Tree, “JINEN” (Opens Apr. 19)</strong><br />
 This traveling exhibition begins in Joshua Tree, where organic sculptures will be set against the desert setting, and then will head to the redwoods off California’s Mendocino coast. Presented by Curator’s Cube Tokyo gallery, the exhibition brings together new works by four of their represented artists: Dan John Anderson, Ido Yoshimoto, Kazunori Hamana, and Yu Kobayashi. Inspired by one another and the natural world, the pieces include sculptures of salvaged redwood and large painted ceramic pots. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C45N_SXvnaQ/"><em>curatorscube.com</em></a></p>
<p><strong>London, “Lindokuhle Sobekwa: Heart of the Garden” (Until May 8)</strong><br />
 This is South African photographer Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s debut in London, at Goodman Gallery. His newest body of work is a documentation of his birthplace near Johannesburg and his grandmother’s home in the Eastern Cape, through which Sobekwa explores the lasting effects of apartheid—which divided rural and urban areas—on his family history. <a href="https://www.goodman-gallery.com/exhibitions/london-gallery-lindokuhle-sobekwa-heart-of-the-garden"><em>goodman-gallery.com</em></a></p>
<p><strong>London, “Richard Serra: Six Large Drawings” (Until May 18)</strong>
 Following American artist Richard Serra’s passing late last month, David Zwirner gallery presents six of his paintings—the last exhibit conceived by Serra in his lifetime. Depicting rich geometry produced by thick strokes of black paintstick, the paintings reflect the play between mass and depth that the late artist revolutionized. <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/2024/richard-serra-six-large-drawings"><em>davidzwirner.com</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Los Angeles, “Hippolyte Bayard: A Persistent Pioneer” (Until July 7)</strong><br />
 A little-known pioneer in the history of photography, Hippolyte Bayard was a French bureaucrat who invented his own method of photography, the direct positive process. He also presented the first-ever photograph exhibit in 1839. The Getty Museum brings his influence full circle, exhibiting his carefully captured photographs, including the world’s first staged self-portraits. <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/bayard/index.html"><em>getty.edu</em></a></p>
<p><strong>New York City, “Somewhere to Roost” (Opens Apr. 12)</strong><br />
 This exhibit’s title is taken from “Birds Got to Have Somewhere to Roost,” an artwork by the late American artist Thornton Dial Sr., whose work addresses racial oppression in the United States. With the theme of “home” in mind, The American Folk Art Museum brings together 60 textiles, photographs, and sculptures to examine what home means to different artists. <a href="https://folkartmuseum.org/exhibitions/somewhere-to-roost/"><em>folkartmuseum.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Paris, “Matsutani” (Until May 19)</strong><br />
 Osaka-born artist Takesada Matsutani has lived and worked in Paris for the past 60 years, and his momentum has not slowed. Known for his use of wood glue to create bubbling and dripping canvases, Matsutani’s works all share a lifelike three-dimensional quality. Showcasing his impressive career, Hauser &amp; Wirth presents older, rarely seen works alongside his newest pieces created for the show. <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/takesada-matsutani-paris-2024/"><em>hauserwirth.com</em></a></p></div>

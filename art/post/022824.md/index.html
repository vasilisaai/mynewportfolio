<p><strong>Richmond, “Julia Child: A Recipe for Life” (Opens Mar. 16)</strong>On The French Chef, Julia Child taught Americans how to bake a soufflé, and other secrets of cooking French cuisine at home. Armed with a passion for teaching, she was one of the first women to host a cooking show. The Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture celebrates the tenacious, passionate woman behind the camera, who was just as authentic as her beloved TV appearance. <a href="https://virginiahistory.org/exhibitions/julia-child-recipe-life"><em>virginiahistory.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Houston, “Janet Sobel: All-Over” (Until Aug. 11)</strong>Janet Sobel was a mother of five when she first started painting in 1939. In her merely four-year career, she shot to fame in NYC’s art world and was the first to introduce the technique of “all-over” abstraction. Though she is primarily known today in association with Pollock, her paintings, presented together for the first time in over six decades, speak for themselves in this exhibit by The Menil Collection. <a href="https://www.menil.org/exhibitions/370-janet-sobel-all-over"><em>menil.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>New York, “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism” (Until July 28)</strong>The Harlem Renaissance radically shaped international modern art, though it seldom gets its due. The Metropolitan Museum of Art presents New York City’s first survey of the subject in nearly 40 years. Upward of 150 works by Black artists depict everyday modern life in the 1920s as New York City’s Harlem, Chicago’s South Side, and cities nationwide were shaped by the millions of Black Americans leaving the segregated South. <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-harlem-renaissance-and-transatlantic-modernism"><em>metmuseum.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>New York, “Toshiko Takaezu: Worlds Within” (Opens Mar. 20)</strong>The signature closed-form ceramics of Toshiko Takaezu have a beautiful charm to them, like each round sculpture has a mind of its own. The Isamu Noguchi Museum presents some 200 objects that chronicle her life and the evolution of her work, from her early life in Hawaii to her studies in Michigan. Catch the retrospective in Long Island, or when it travels to several other locations in the U.S. <a href="https://www.noguchi.org/museum/exhibitions/view/toshiko-takaezu/"><em>noguchi.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Paris, “Match: Design &amp; Sport” (Opens Mar. 13)</strong>We love how design looks, but when it comes to sport, good design must draw not only on aesthetics but aerodynamics. With the incoming Paris 2024 Olympics, the Musée du Luxembourg dissects this relationship, showcasing the power of design in making world records and changing the game—as well as fashion designers inspired by athletic wear—and what the future holds. <a href="https://museeduluxembourg.fr/en/agenda/evenement/match"><em>museeduluxembourg.fr</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Paris, “Brancusi” (Opens Mar. 27)</strong>The 20th-century sculptor Constantin Brancusi felt his studio to be inseparable from his art. In his will he left it to the French state, who would bequeath it to the Centre Pompidou to reconstruct and showcase his work as it was. Now, to coincide with the major renovations and relocation of the studio, the museum is putting together the largest collection of Brancusi’s work ever, with nearly 200 sculptures, as well as photographs, archives, and tools from the studio. <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/program/calendar/event/mb7ZAkc"><em>centrepompidou.fr</em></a></p></div>

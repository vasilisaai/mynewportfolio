        <div class="post-body"><p><strong>Brussels, “Obstakles: Willem Oorebeek” (Until April 27)</strong> “Something must be done to make looking a conscious activity,” said Dutch artist Willem Oorebeek ahead of his U.S. solo debut at Robert Miller Gallery in 2012. He was presenting a series he called “Blackouts,” images printed over with black ink, making them difficult to see. “In order to see a blackout,” Oorebeek explains, “you have to do the choreography of looking.” His work is concerned with the numbing effects of mass reproduction and oversaturation, and he magnifies newspaper prints, superimposes covers of fashion magazines, and plays with graphic design to subvert how we see. This survey in Brussels, where the artist lives and works, presents 40 of his pieces from the 80s and 90s. <a href="https://www.wiels.org/en/exhibitions/obstakles"><em>wiels.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Paris, “Raymond Saunders: Déménagement” (Until March 22)</strong> “I will do the opposite of what I think it is that someone’s thinking,” said Raymond Saunders in a 1994 interview. “I will scribble when they think that’s all I can do, and then I will draw when they think that’s all I do.” Since the 1960s, the artist has refused to be cornered by expectation. His paintings and abstract collages from scraps of media defy genre and words. Paris, where he had a studio and spent his summers, is a second home for the Pittsburgh-born artist, who now resides in Oakland, California. As part of a revived interest in Saunders, this show presents his chalk paintings, works on paper, and paintings on doors. <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/2025/raymond-saunders"><em>davidzwirner.com</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Paris, “Suzanne Valadon” (Until May 26)</strong> Before she was a painter, Suzane Valadon was a muse for Parisian painters. When she began painting herself at 44, in 1909, she depicted women without pretense: lounging, bored, dancing, thinking. The French painter was the first woman admitted to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, but she never went. She was also the first woman painter to paint a male nude portrait. Yet before 2023, the remarkable artist hadn’t been the subject of a monograph since 1967. This exhibition, coming from Barcelona, stops in Paris with 200 works covering over 40 years. <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/program/calendar/event/5moMjyy"><em>centrepompidou.fr</em></a></p>
<p><strong>New York, “Weegee: Society of the Spectacle” (Until May 5)</strong> It’s rumored that Weegee, born Arthur Fellig, got his nickname because, like a Ouija board, he seemingly had psychic powers: The street photographer knew where to be and when. Where there was crime, there was Weegee. Weegee emigrated from what is now western Ukraine to New York in 1909, when he was 10, eventually making a career out of tracking down crime in New York City and selling his stark photos of wrongdoing to popular tabloids. Where else to present Weegee’s photos of New York than the very same neighborhood he prowled 100 years ago? <a href="https://www.icp.org/exhibitions/weegee-society-of-the-spectacle"><em>icp.org</em></a></p></div>

        <div class="post-body"><p><strong>Chicago, “Germane Barnes: Columnar Disorder” (Until Jan. 27)</strong><br />
 An architect, designer, and professor, Germane Barnes’ art and scholarship is redefining the assumptions of architecture: His thesis on “non-white contribution to Roman and Italian architecture” won him the Wheelwright Prize in 2021, and his work was featured in MoMA’s first exhibition to examine how race has influenced American architecture. “We get this one Eurocentric idea of what architecture is supposed to be, and it’s a very, very small representation of a field that is actually very diverse,” the Chicago native said in a 2021 interview. His first solo museum show reimagines ancient Greek columns, a foundation in the study of architecture, into designs that celebrate Black history and experience. <a href="https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/10310/germane-barnes-columnar-disorder"><em>a</em></a><a href="https://www.artic.edu/press/press-releases/364/germane-barnes-columnar-disorder-opens-sept-21"><em>rtic.edu</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Cincinnati, “Discovering Ansel Adams” (Until Jan. 19)</strong><br />
 Infatuated with the sprawling landscapes of the American West, the American photographer spent his lifetime documenting and protecting its beauty (he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for “his efforts to preserve this country’s wild and scenic areas, both on film and on earth”). Presenting 80 photos and ephemera from the first half of his career, this show is a valuable reminder of the compelling power of photography in the day of iPhone photos and endless digitally created delights. <a href="https://www.cincinnatiartmuseum.org/art/exhibitions/discovering-ansel-adams/"><em>cincinnatiartmuseum.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>London, “André Butzer” (Until Dec. 14)</strong><br />
 From Stuttgart, André Butzer became known in the early 2000s for his colossal paintings of characters with perpetual side-eye. The painter cites sources of inspiration like Edvard Munch and Walt Disney—a mixture of the heavy emotions of European expressionism and American pop culture, and a reflection of the contrasting political poles Germans were undergoing at the turn of the century. In this show, Butzer presents 16 of his newest works, including colorful additions to an abstract series he began in 2010. <a href="https://www.maxhetzler.com/exhibitions/andre-butzer-2024-41-dover-street"><em>maxhetzler.com</em></a></p>
<p><strong>New York, “The Way I See It: Selections from the KAWS Collection” (Opens Oct. 10)</strong><br />
 The American Pop artist KAWS is famed for his cartoonish sculptures (think Mickey Mouse with an edge) and a wild commercial success accompanying the rise of streetwear into the mainstream. Since the mid 1990s, he has also amassed a vast collection of 3,000 works on paper, including drawings as well as comics, commercial illustrations, and graffiti sketches. Two hundred of them—by a variety of artists including Willem de Kooning, Robert Crumb, Jim Nutt, and Gladys Nilsson—will be shown here. <a href="https://drawingcenter.org/exhibitions/kaws-collection"><em>drawingcenter.org</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Rome, “Helen Frankenthaler: Painting on Paper, 1990–2002” (Until Nov. 23)</strong><br />
 “The landscapes were in my arms as I did it,” is how American painter Helen Frankenthaler described the compulsion behind her first soak-stained painting, <em>Mountains and Sea</em>, which spurred her professional career in 1952. Abandoning the paintbrush, Frankenthaler instead poured diluted oil paint straight onto the canvas. Later on, she would paint on paper the size of her large canvases. Eighteen of these ruminative paintings on paper are shown, some for the first time, in this exhibit. <a href="https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2024/helen-frankenthaler-painting-on-paper-1990-2002/"><em>gagosian.com</em></a></p></div>
